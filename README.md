# Modern OpenGL Rendering Engine

## Introduction

This project is a modern OpenGL-based rendering engine developed as part of a college course. The goal was to explore and implement various advanced graphics techniques using shader programming. The engine allows for the creation of visually rich environments by integrating several important features in computer graphics, along with a user-friendly interface.

## Features

This rendering engine includes the following key features:

- **Skybox Rendering**: Implements a dynamic skybox to create realistic sky environments.
- **Lighting Effects**:
  - **Directional Lighting**: Simulates light coming from a distant source, like the sun.
  - **Point Lighting**: Represents light emitted from a specific point, like a light bulb.
  - **Spot Lighting**: Focuses light in a specific direction, similar to a flashlight.
- **Blinn-Phong Shading**: Enhances the realism of objects by simulating the way light interacts with surfaces.
- **Normal Mapping**: Adds detailed surface texture to objects without increasing the polygon count, creating the illusion of complex surface details.
- **Reflections and Refractions using Fresnel**: Implements realistic reflections and refractions on surfaces, simulating how light interacts with transparent materials like glass or water.
- **Object Insertion**: Allows for adding and manipulating 3D objects within the scene.
- **Animation**: Enables the creation of basic animations for objects, making them move or change over time.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Implements a method for controlling the movement of jointed structures, such as robotic arms or animated characters.
- **Anaglyph Effect for 3D Visualization**: Creates a stereoscopic 3D effect, allowing users to visualize scenes with depth perception using red-cyan glasses.
- **User Interface (UI) with ImGUI**: A simple and intuitive UI built using ImGUI, allowing users to interact with the rendering engine easily. The UI lets users adjust lighting parameters, insert objects, control animations, and more.

## Usage

This engine is designed to demonstrate these features in a simple and accessible way, making it a great learning tool for understanding the fundamentals of graphics programming.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the different features!
